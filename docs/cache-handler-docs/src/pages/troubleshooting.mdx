### Verifying that the Cache Handler works

You can verify if the cache handler is active by using either of the following methods:

#### Method 1: Console Logging

Add `console.log` statements to your cache handler:

```js filename="cache-handler.js"
/* ... */
const cache = {
    async get(key) {
        console.log('cache.get', key);
        return cacheStore.get(key);
    },
    async set(key, value) {
        console.log('cache.set', key, value);
        cacheStore.set(key, value);
    },
};
/* ... */
```

Execute your application as usual:

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm run build
npm run start
```

The console should display output the application starts and any page is opened in your browser:

```
cache.get ...
cache.set ...
```

#### Method 2: Debug Mode

Activate debug mode by setting the `NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE` environment variable:

Locate or create a `.env.local` file in your project's root directory and add the following:

```plaintext filename=".env.local" copy
NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE=1
```

Build and execute your application:

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm run build
npm run start
```

Verbose output should appear in your console when the application starts and any page is opened in your browser:

```
using custom cache handler @neshca/cache-handler with 1 Handlers and file system caching
using custom cache handler @neshca/cache-handler with 1 Handlers and file system caching
```

Note: During the build stage, it's normal to see `@neshca/cache-handler is not configured yet` several times.

#### Troubleshooting

If the cache handler is not active:

1. Verify that the cache handler has been correctly installed, imported, and configured. Refer to the [Installation and the First Steps](/installation) section for guidance.
2. Ensure that the `NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE` environment variable is set. To verify, add the following to your `next.config.js` file:

    ```js filename="next.config.js" copy
    console.log('NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE', process.env.NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE);
    ```

    When you build or run your application, `NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE 1` should appear in your console.
