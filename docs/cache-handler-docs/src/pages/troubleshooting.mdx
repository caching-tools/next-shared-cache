### Verifying that the Cache Handler works

You can verify if the cache handler is active by using either of the following methods:

#### Method 1: Console Logging

Add `console.log` statements to your cache handler:

```js filename="cache-handler.mjs"
/* ... */
const handler = {
  name: 'my-cache-handler',
  async get(key) {
    console.log('handler.get', key);
    return cacheStore.get(key);
  },
  async set(key, value) {
    console.log('handler.set', key, value);
    cacheStore.set(key, value);
  },
};
/* ... */
```

Execute your application as usual:

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm run build
npm run start
```

The console should display the output the application starts and any page is opened in your browser:

```
handler.get ...
handler.set ...
```

#### Method 2: Debug Mode

Activate debug mode by setting the `NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE` environment variable:

Locate or create a `.env.local` file in your project's root directory and add the following:

```plaintext filename=".env.local" copy
NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE=1
```

Build and execute your application:

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm run build
npm run start
```

A verbose output should appear in your server console when the application starts and any page is opened in your browser:

```
using custom cache handler @neshca/cache-handler is not configured yet
[CacheHandler] Instance created with provided context.
[CacheHandler] Creating new CacheHandler configuration.
Connecting Redis client...
[CacheHandler] Cache configuration retrieved from onCreation hook.
Redis client connected.
[CacheHandler] [handlers: [redis-stack]] Successfully created CacheHandler configuration.
[CacheHandler] [method: get] [key: /app/with-params/dynamic-true/200] Started retrieving value in order.
[CacheHandler] [handler: redis-stack] [method: get] [key: /app/with-params/dynamic-true/200] Started retrieving value.
```

Note: During the build stage, it's normal to see `@neshca/cache-handler is not configured yet` several times.

#### Troubleshooting

If the cache handler is not active:

1. Verify that the cache handler has been correctly installed, imported, and configured. Refer to the [Installation and the First Steps](/installation) section for guidance.
2. Ensure that the `NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE` environment variable is set. To verify, add the following to your `next.config.js` file:

   ```js filename="next.config.js" copy
   console.log('NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE', process.env.NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE);
   ```

   When you build or run your application, `NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE 1` should appear in your console.

3. If you're using a third-party library to retrieve data or database records (e.g., `axios`, `node-fetch`, `pg`) within the App directory, ensure you're using the [`unstable_cache` â†—](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_cache). By default, Next.js will cache only native fetch calls.
