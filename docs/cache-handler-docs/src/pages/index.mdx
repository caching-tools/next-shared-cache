Welcome to `@neshca/cache-handler` (pronounced /ˈnæʃkʌ/), a specialized ISR/Data cache API crafted for Next.js applications. This library simplifies configuring shared cache strategies in distributed environments, such as multiple, independent application instances. It offers a flexible and easy-to-integrate solution for custom cache strategies, especially for Redis.

---

Next.js applications are often deployed in a self-hosted distributed environment, where multiple instances of the same application are running simultaneously. In such cases, the default Next.js cache is not shared between instances, causing the data to diverge between independent instances because load balancers route requests to a different instance every time. Another significant issue with the default cache setup is on-demand revalidation; it requires manual revalidation across all application replicas.

## Features

- **Shared Cache for Distributed Environments**: Perfect for self-hosted deployments with multiple application instances.
- **Easy Customization**: Provides a straightforward API with pre-configured Handlers.
- **On-Demand Revalidation**: Simplifies revalidation across all application replicas.
- **TTL Management**: Automatic cache cleanup to keep storage space efficient.
- **Support for Next.js Routers**: Full support and one setup for the Pages and the App Router.
- **`neshCache` Function**: Utilize the [`neshCache`](/functions/nesh-cache) function to replace `unstable_cache` for more control over caching.
- **`neshClassicCache` Function**: Use the CacheHandler in the Pages Router to cache the result of expensive operations in the `getServerSideProps` and API routes.
- **Pre-populate the Cache with Initial Data**: Automatically pre-populate the cache with the initial data when the application starts using the [instrumentation hook ↗](/usage/populating-cache-on-start).
