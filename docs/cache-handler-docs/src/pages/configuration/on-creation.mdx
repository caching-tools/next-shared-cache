The `onCreation` static method of the `CacheHandler` class is designed to facilitate the creation of a custom cache instance with configurable behavior. It accepts a single argument, `onCreationHook`, which is a function that returns a `CacheHandlerConfig` object.

## `onCreationHook`

The `onCreation` method expects a function of type `OnCreationHook`, which is defined as follows:

```typescript
type OnCreationHook = (context: CacheCreationContext) => Promise<CacheHandlerConfig> | CacheHandlerConfig;
```

### Arguments

#### `context`

The `context` argument is an object of type `CacheCreationContext`, providing additional information for cache configuration. It includes the following properties:

1. **`serverDistDir` (string):**

   - Description: The absolute path to the Next.js server directory.
   - Purpose: This path is critical for locating server-side resources and files that may be required by the cache implementation, such as directories for storing cache data in the file system.

2. **`dev` (boolean, optional):**

   - Description: Indicates whether the Next.js application is running in development mode.
   - Purpose: This flag can be used to alter cache behavior based on the environment.

3. **`buildId` (string, optional):**

   - Description: A unique identifier for the current build of the Next.js application, generated during the `next build` process.
   - Purpose: The `buildId` may be used as a prefix for namespacing cache keys, ensuring distinct and relevant cache data for each build of the application.

### Return Value

The [`CacheHandlerConfig`](/api-reference/cache-handler-config) type is designed to specify the list of cache Handlers and [TTL policy](/api-reference/ttl-parameters).

## Example

Here's an example of how the `onCreation` method might be used:

```js filename="cache-handler.mjs"
CacheHandler.onCreation(async (context) => {
  const mainHandler = {
    // Define custom get, set, and other Handler methods
  };

  const fallbackHandler = {
    // Define custom get, set, and other Handler methods
  };

  return {
    handlers: [mainHandler, fallbackHandler],
    ttl: { defaultStaleAge: 3600, estimateExpireAge: (staleAge) => staleAge * 2 },
  };
});
```

In this example, the `onCreation` method configures two Handlers, and a common TTL policy for the cache.
