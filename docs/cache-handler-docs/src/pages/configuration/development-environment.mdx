## Using `@neshca/cache-handler` in development environment

Since the primary purpose of `@neshca/cache-handler` is to accommodate the sharing of the cache between multiple and independent replicas of the Next.js application, there is no need to use it in a development environment.

The easiest way to turn off the cache handler in a development environment is to use `process.env.NODE_ENV`:

```js filename="next.config.js" copy
const nextConfig = {
    /* ... */
    experimental: {
        incrementalCacheHandlerPath:
            process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? undefined : require.resolve('./cache-handler'),
    },
    /* ... */
};
```
