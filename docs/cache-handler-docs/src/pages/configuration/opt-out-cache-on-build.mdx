## Building the App Without Redis Cache Connection

There are scenarios, especially during deployment, where your Redis server may not be immediately available. This can occur when the Redis server and your app are deployed simultaneously. In such cases, it's important to configure your build process to handle the absence of the Redis cache. Here's how you can adapt your setup to build the app without requiring an active connection to the Redis cache:

### Configuration Steps

1. **Modify the `cache-handler.mjs` File**: Adjust the `onCreation` method in your `cache-handler.mjs` file to conditionally connect to the Redis cache. The modified code should look like this:

   ```js filename="cache-handler.mjs" copy
   IncrementalCache.onCreation(async () => {
     let redisCache;

     if (process.env.REDIS_AVAILABLE) {
       await client.connect();

       redisCache = await createRedisCache({
         client,
       });
     }

     // The cache array can contain undefined values. The will be filtered out by IncrementalCache.
     const cache = [redisCache];

     return {
       cache,
       // Always use the file system cache when building the app without any cache.
       useFileSystem: !cache.some(Boolean),
     };
   });
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Check**: The `process.env.REDIS_AVAILABLE` environment variable is used to determine if the server has already started. This ensures that the Redis client attempts a connection only when the server is up and running.

3. **Fallback to File System Cache**: When the Redis cache is not connected (e.g., during the build process), the setup falls back to using the file system cache. This ensures that your app can still be built and run effectively, even without the Redis cache.

### Notes:

- This setup is particularly useful in continuous integration and deployment pipelines where the availability of external services like Redis might not be guaranteed at build time.
