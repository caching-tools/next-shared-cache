# TTLParameters

```typescript
type TTLParameters = {
  defaultStaleAge: number;
  estimateExpireAge(staleAge: number): number;
};
```

## Properties

### `defaultStaleAge`

The time in seconds for when the cache entry becomes stale. Defaults to 1 year.

Stale age is the time after which the cache entry is considered stale, can be served from the cache, and should be revalidated. Revalidation is handled by the `CacheHandler` class.

### `estimateExpireAge`

Estimates the expiration age based on the stale age.

Expire age is the time after which the cache entry is considered expired and should be removed from the cache and must not be served.

The provided callback will be wrapped in a normalizing function to ensure that the result is a non-negative integer.

#### Parameters

- `staleAge` - The stale age in seconds. Defaults to 1 year.

  The stale age is the time you have provided in the `revalidate` option in your [`getStaticProps` ↗](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-props#revalidate) or in the [`fetch` ↗](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#time-based-revalidation) method. If you did not specify the `revalidate` option, the stale age will be the default stale age.

  After the stale age, the cache entry is considered stale, can be served from the cache, and should be revalidated. Revalidation is handled by the `CacheHandler` class.

#### Return value

The expire age in seconds.

## Example

In this example, the `CacheHandler` class is configured to use TTL parameters with a default stale age of 1 hour and an expire age that is twice the stale age. If you have specified the `revalidate` option in your `getStaticProps` or `fetch` method, the stale age will be the time you have provided in the `revalidate` option, and the expire age will be twice the stale age. This setup may be useful if you want to revalidate the cache entry in the background.

```js filename="cache-handler.mjs" copy
CacheHandler.onCreation(async () => {
  const mainHandler = {
    // ...
  };

  const fallbackHandler = {
    // ...
  };

  return {
    handlers: [mainHandler, fallbackHandler],
    // will apply to all Handlers
    ttl: {
      defaultStaleAge: 3600,
      estimateExpireAge: (staleAge) => staleAge * 2,
    },
  };
});
```

## Caveats

TTL parameters are not used for the pages with `fallback: false` in `getStaticPaths`. Such pages will be cached indefinitely and will not be deleted from the cache after the expiration age. Instead, they only will be updated after the stale and expire age.
