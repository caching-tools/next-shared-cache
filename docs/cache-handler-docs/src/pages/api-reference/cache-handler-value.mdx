# CacheHandlerValue

```typescript
type CacheHandlerValue = {
  lastModified: number;
  value: IncrementalCacheValue | null;
  tags: string[];
  lifespan: LifespanParameters | null;
};
```

## Properties

### `lastModified`

Time in milliseconds when the cache entry was last modified. It is used by the Next.js server to determine if the cache entry is stale or fresh.

### `value`

The value to be cached. It may be a pre-rendered HTML page with its props, a result of a `fetch` call. It may also be `null` if the page is not found.

### `tags`

Tags associated with the cache entry. They are used for on-demand revalidation. They will be checked by the Handler's [`revalidateTag`](/api-reference/handler#revalidatetag) method to determine whether to delete the cache entry or not.

### `lifespan`

The lifespan parameters for the cache entry. It may be `null` for pages with `fallback: false` in `getStaticPaths`. Consider these pages as always fresh and never stale. See the [`LifespanParameters`](/api-reference/lifespan-parameters) type for more information.

## Caveats

Some cache values may contain a `Buffer` object. When you stringify the cache value, the `Buffer` object will be converted to an array of numbers. It is very space-inefficient. To overcome this, you can use the [`@neshca/json-replacer-reviver`](https://github.com/caching-tools/next-shared-cache/tree/canary/packages/json-replacer-reviver) package to convert the `Buffer` object to a base64 string and vice versa.
