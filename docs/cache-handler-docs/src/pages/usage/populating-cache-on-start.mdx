## Populating the Cache with the Initial Data

This feature is experimental. To use it, you must explicitly opt in by defining [`experimental.instrumentationHook = true;` 竊余(https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/instrumentationHook) in your `next.config.js` file.

Next.js pre-renders pages during the build process and stores them on the disk. This procedure bypasses the `CacheHandler`, so pre-rendered pages and routes are not added to the CacheHandler cache stores. To populate the cache with the initial data, you can utilize the `registerInitialCache` function from `@neshca/cache-handler/instrumentation`:

```js filename="instrumentation.ts" copy
export async function register() {
  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {
    const { registerInitialCache } = await import('@neshca/cache-handler/instrumentation');
    // Assuming that your CacheHandler configuration is in the root of the project and the instrumentation is in the src directory.
    // Please adjust the path accordingly.
    // CommonJS CacheHandler configuration is also supported.
    const CacheHandler = (await import('../cache-handler.mjs')).default;

    await registerInitialCache(CacheHandler, {
      // By default, it populates the cache with pre-rendered pages, routes, and fetch calls.
      // You can disable these features by setting the options to false.
      // For example, if you want to populate the cache with only pre-rendered pages, you can set the options as follows:
      fetch: false,
      routes: false,
    });
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Use <code>NEXT_RUNTIME</code> environment variable to ensure that the instrumentation is only executed in Node.js. Use
  dynamic import to avoid bundling issues.
</Callout>

This instrumentation will fill the cache with the initial data when the application starts. The duration of this process may vary based on the number and size of pages, routes, and fetch calls.

### Using `output: 'standalone'` in `next.config.js`

If you use the `output: 'standalone'` option in your `next.config.js` file, you must copy the `fetch-cache` directory to the `standalone` directory. Otherwise, the instrumentation will not pre-populate the cache with the initial fetch calls data.

To copy the `fetch-cache` directory, run the following command in your project root directory:

```sh
mkdir -p .next/standalone/.next/cache/fetch-cache
cp .next/cache/fetch-cache/* .next/standalone/.next/cache/fetch-cache/
```

Or using `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
COPY .next/cache/fetch-cache/ .next/standalone/.next/cache/fetch-cache/
```

#### Caveats

When using the `output: 'standalone'` option in a monorepo, you may need to adjust the paths in the above command to match your project structure.

For example, they may look like this:

```sh
mkdir -p .next/standalone/<path-to-your-app-in-the-monorepo>/.next/cache/fetch-cache
cp .next/cache/fetch-cache/* .next/standalone/<path-to-your-app-in-the-monorepo>/.next/cache/fetch-cache/
```

You may also need to configure `outputFileTracingRoot` in your `next.config.js` to work locally. Refer to the [Next.js `output: standalone` option 竊余(https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/output) for more information.
