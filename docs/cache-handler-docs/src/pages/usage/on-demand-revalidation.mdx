# On-demand revalidation

Next.js provides a way to revalidate a page or a result of a `fetch` call on demand. `@neshca/cache-handler` supports this feature with one limitation: `revalidatePath` only works for the Pages Router.

## Usage

### Pages Router

The Pages Router supports only the `response.revalidate(path)`.

See [Using On-Demand Revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#using-on-demand-revalidation) in the Next.js documentation.

#### `response.revalidate(path)` caveat

Calling `response.revalidate(path)` will synchronously call `getStaticProps` and render the page with a given `path`. Then it will revalidate the cache for this page. If you want to revalidate multiple paths at once, you need to call `response.revalidate(path)` multiple times.

### App Router

The App Router supports both `revalidatePath` and `revalidateTag` functions. These functions will remove the cache values from the store.

See [On-demand Revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#on-demand-revalidation) in the Next.js documentation.

#### `revalidatePath` caveat

The `revalidatePath` function works differently from the `response.revalidate(path)` and `revalidateTag` functions. It does not revalidate the cached `fetch` result immediately. Instead, it marks the cache as revalidated and the next request will revalidate the cache.

If you are creating a custom cache Handler, you need to manually mark the cache as revalidated in Handler's `revalidateTag` method. Later in the Handler's `get` method, you must check if the cache is revalidated and return `null` if necessary. See [Custom Redis strings example](/usage/creating-a-custom-handler#guide)
