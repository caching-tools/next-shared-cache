## Latest Release

ðŸŽ‰ **Version 1.7.0** has been released! It now includes the [`registerInitialCache` instrumentation hook â†—](https://caching-tools.github.io/next-shared-cache/usage/populating-cache-on-start), which allows the cache to be pre-populated with the initial data when the application starts.

Do not forget the [`experimental-redis-cluster`](https://caching-tools.github.io/next-shared-cache/handlers/experimental-redis-cluster) Handler for Redis Cluster support from a previous release.

## Overview

Welcome to `@neshca/cache-handler` (pronounced /ËˆnÃ¦ÊƒkÊŒ/), a specialized ISR/Data cache API crafted for Next.js applications. This library simplifies configuring shared cache strategies in distributed environments, such as multiple, independent application instances. It offers a flexible and easy-to-integrate solution for custom cache strategies, especially for Redis.

### Features

- **Shared Cache for Distributed Environments**: Perfect for self-hosted deployments with multiple application instances.
- **Easy Customization**: Provides a straightforward API with pre-configured Handlers.
- **On-Demand Revalidation**: Simplifies revalidation across all application replicas.
- **TTL Management**: Automatic cache cleanup to keep storage space efficient.
- **Support for Next.js Routers**: Full support and one setup for the Pages and the App Router.
- **`neshCache` Function**: Utilize the [`neshCache` â†—](https://caching-tools.github.io/next-shared-cache/functions/nesh-cache) function to replace `unstable_cache` for more control over caching.
- **Pre-populate the Cache with Initial Data**: Automatically pre-populate the cache with the initial data when the application starts using the [instrumentation hook â†—](https://caching-tools.github.io/next-shared-cache/usage/populating-cache-on-start).
