Welcome to [`@neshca/cache-handler`](./packages/cache-handler/README.md) (pronounced /ˈnæʃkʌ/), a specialized ISR/Data cache API crafted for Next.js applications. This library simplifies configuring shared cache strategies in distributed environments, such as multiple, independent application instances. It offers a flexible and easy-to-integrate solution for custom cache strategies, especially for Redis.

### Features

- **Shared Cache for Distributed Environments**: Perfect for self-hosted deployments with multiple application instances.
- **Easy Customization**: Provides a straightforward API with pre-configured Handlers.
- **On-Demand Revalidation**: Simplifies revalidation across all application replicas.
- **TTL Management**: Automatic cache cleanup to keep storage space efficient.
- **Support for Next.js Routers**: Full support and one setup for the Pages and the App Router.
- **`neshCache` Function**: Utilize the [`neshCache`](https://caching-tools.github.io/next-shared-cache/functions/nesh-cache) function to replace `unstable_cache` for more control over caching.
